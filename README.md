Qlik Sense Scalability Tools Extension

** Qlik Sense Scalability Tools knowledge required **

This extends Qlik Sense Scalability Tools (https://community.qlik.com/docs/DOC-8878) and helps to prepare Qlik Sense to perform scalability tests in multi applications scenarios, for example SaaS. This allows you to generate number of QS streams and apps. For example, you can generate 100 QS streams and apps and then run scalability tasks with 1 or more users per QS app.
